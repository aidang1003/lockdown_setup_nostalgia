<h2 class="responsive">What Will Go Back To Normal</h2>

<p class="responsive">
  Going back to normal, people will go out with friends and family again. Mostly
  this will be because restrictions will be lifted, but also people will not
  feel bad about potentially spreading disease. Additionally, being locked in
  for a while has made people appreciate their freedom and not take it for
  granted. Schools will go back to normal. Teaching school to little kids was
  frusterating enough before it went virtual. School will always be something
  taught in person.

<h2 class="responsive">What Sill Stay the Same</h2>

<p class="responsive">
  The "new normal" is certainly true. Due to COVID people in America will likely
  continue wearing masks. People are realizing it is not that hard to do an
  dramatically reduces the chance of spreading disease. It will be another step
  in advanced society similar to basic sanitation like washing hands. Working
  from home will become a new normal as well. Companies were already transfering
  to employees working from home if possible. With recent innovations in working
  from home technology, companies will be more likely to adapt these changes
  permanently.
